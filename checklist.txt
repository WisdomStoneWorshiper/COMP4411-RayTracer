Trace Bells and Whistles Checklist for Grading
(submit ONLY if you have implemented any B&Ws in the following)

HKUST login(s): kkotecha, klloaj

Delete yes/no when appropriate

W adaptive termination				yes
W antialiasing by supersampling			no
+W jittering					no
B spot lights					no
B background image				no
B accelerate shadow atteuation			no
B overlapping tranparent objects		yes

Assumptions: If one object is completely inside another object, the overlapping space will have index of refraction of the inner object. If two objects are intersecting, the overlapping space will have index of refraction of the object farther from our eye.
.ray file included for checking

BW texture mapping (diffuse and transparent)	no

BW Warn model					no
2B bump mapping					no
2B solid/procedural texture			no
2B new geometry (quadrics)			no
2B height fields				no
2B first 					no
